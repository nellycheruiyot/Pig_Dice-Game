# Pig Dice Game WebApp

### By **Nelly Cheruiyot**

## Description
This is a web application that allows two users to play a pig dice game. The game rules are as follows:

- Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

	- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
	- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
	-If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

- The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, for a given turn:
	- Player 1 rolls 5 then 6 and holds. Player 1 turn score = 11 and becomes Player 2's turn.
	- Player 1 rolls 5 then 1. Player 1 turn score is 0 and is forced to hand over the turn to Player 2.
	- Player 1 rolls 1. Player 1 turn score is 0 and is forced to hand over the turn to Player 2.
The game proceeds this way for each turn with each player's score updated after each turn. Once a winner is reached, the players have to restart the game by clicking on the 'New Game' button


## Demo
Here is a working live demo:  https://nellycheruiyot.github.io/Pig_Dice-Game

## Features
- Takes player names input from users
- Uses a JavaScript constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, methods to create a Player object used to track each player's score and turn. Each Player object contains the following properties:
	- playerNumber - used as an identifier for each player
	- playerName
	- rollScore - keeps track of the what the rolls (1,2,3,4,5 or 6) when a player rolls the die
	- turnScore - keeps track of the score for a given turn. A turn consists of one or more rolls until a player holds or rolls a 1.
	- totalScore - keeps track of a player's total game score
	- turn - used to indicate if it is a player's turn. 1 = it is the player's turn, 0 = it is not the player's turn.
	- win_flag - used to indicate if a player is the winner. 1 = player is the winner, 0 = player is not the winner.
- Uses jQuery and DOM manipulation and traversal to control what gets displayed when a player interacts with the web page:
	- Welcome page where the users enter the player names in order to start the game. This page is hidden once the players start the game
	- Playing page where the players play the game. Keeps track of each players scores through all the turns until a winner is determined. Displays the winner and gives the players a 'New Game' button to start a new game.
